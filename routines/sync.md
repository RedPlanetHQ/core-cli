Please perform a comprehensive sync of my work:

1. **Check Integrations**: Review connected integrations (GitHub, Linear, Slack, etc.) for:
   - Open pull requests that need my attention
   - Assigned issues or tasks
   - Mentions or notifications
   - Any urgent items requiring action

2. **Create New Tasks**: Based on integration findings, create tasks in the task system for any items that need my attention.

3. **Review Existing Tasks**: Analyze current tasks and:
   - Update task statuses based on recent work and commits
   - Adjust priorities based on deadlines, dependencies, and importance
   - Mark completed tasks
   - Identify blocked or stale tasks

4. **Prioritization**: Help me prioritize by:
   - Suggesting which tasks should be tackled next
   - Highlighting urgent or high-impact items
   - Recommending a focus area for the current session

Please provide a clear, actionable summary with next steps.
